// Running this application will:

// List a set of menu options:

// View Products for Sale

// View Low Inventory

// Add to Inventory

// Add New Product

// If a manager selects View Products for Sale, the app should list every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.

// If a manager selects View Low Inventory, then it should list all items with an inventory count lower than five.

// If a manager selects Add to Inventory, your app should display a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.

// If a manager selects Add New Product, it should allow the manager to add a completely new product to the store.
